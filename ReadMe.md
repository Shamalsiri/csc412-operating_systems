  \- class Syllabus (pg. 1)

 ## Programing Assignments ##

"The first three assignments will be short and fairly generic, not directly related to operating systems. The purpose of their C programming component is to ensure that you are reasonably competent with fundamental aspects of C such as pointer algebra, 1D and nD array manipulation, bitwise operators, console and file input and output. The next four assignments will be more complex and will deal with applied aspects of operating systems. An assignment schedule is provided at the end of this syllabus."  
  \- class Syllabus (pg. 3)

The programing assignments descriptions found below are excerpts from the syllabus (pg. 9)
 - **Assignment 1 **
  - C programming: Elementary C programming; Passing of arguments to functions and console input/output
